I moved to New York City from Texas with a Bachelors in fine arts in pursuit of a Masters in fine art. I stayed in NYC after earning my degree and started an alternative art space with a some art school friends. We made art and exhibited it in each others DIY shows all over the city. In order to make ends meet, I worked for one of my favorite sculptors in my spare time. 

Over the last 12 years, I've divided my attention between two interests: art and design, more specifically, web design. Tried as I might to keep these interests separate the structure and discipline required to design and build web sites influenced my eccentric art habits. A calming rational balance to my creative impulse. Success and failure in both areas has taught me to two important lessons: first, to prolong playtime long enough to have a an original idea; second, to know when to commit to an idea and see it through to completion.

I love to ride road bicycles and enjoy building and paddling kayaks. In the winter I telemark and xc ski. I married an awesome paddler and social worker with whom I have just had twin boys.
