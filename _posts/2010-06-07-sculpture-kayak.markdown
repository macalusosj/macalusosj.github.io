This kayak is a hand-built, peg-and-lash, skin-on-frame, multi-chine Baidarka. I finished it during the winter of 2010, just as the weather was warming up. The design is by [Tom Yost](http://yostwerks.com/DesignsMenuWood.html "Tom Yost") and the kayak building class was taught by Jack Gilman at JFK Marina in Yonkers, NY.
